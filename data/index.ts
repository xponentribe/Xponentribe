We delve into the factors driving their meteoric demand, analyze their intricate supply chain, and highlight opportunities for listed Indian players. Whether you're an investor or simply curious about groundbreaking advancements, we believe this is a story worth knowing.",

What began as a niche is now triggering a structural shift across the global jewellery value chain—challenging long-standing cartels and unlocking opportunities for new, nimble players. We break down what LGDs are, how their value chain works, why prices have collapsed (and why they may now be near a floor), and highlight where promising opportunities may lie. Whether you're intrigued by innovation or interested in the future of jewellery, this is a story worth knowing.",

This letter is different. It goes beyond performance. It unpacks a worldview that shapes every decision we make at the firm—the belief that markets are not machines, but complex, adaptive systems. And that as humans, we are naturally wired to fail in them. You may have heard this from us in parts. But this is the full picture. If you’ve ever felt confused when good stocks fall, or watched a rally make no sense—this letter is for you. It won’t promise certainty. But it might change how you think about uncertainty.",

We quantify the shifting investment landscape, outlining India's drone and counter-drone roadmap and map the value chain to estimate where the profit pools would migrate to. We believe this is a structural shift that will create a new defense-industrial order for years to come.",

Passenger demand was strong; aircraft availability from manufacturers was not. Similar dynamics have played out at Lufthansa Group and Air New Zealand, where delivery delays and supply-chain disruptions at OEMs and their suppliers have become the binding constraint on fleet growth. This paradox now defines global commercial aerospace. Order books are full, load factors are elevated, and visibility extends well into the next decade—yet aircraft deliveries remain structurally below prior peaks. The bottleneck sits upstream in the traditional aerospace manufacturing system, strained by labour shortages, cost inflation, certification intensity, and weakened supplier balance sheets across North America and Europe.",
